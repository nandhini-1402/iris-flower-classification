# Iris Flower Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal characteristics. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for introductory classification tasks.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which can be found in various machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The target variable is the species of iris, which can be one of three classes: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/iris-flower-classification.git
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the `Iris_Flower_Classification.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run each cell sequentially to see the analysis and results.
3. Modify parameters or algorithms as needed for experimentation.

## Approach
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the dataset, visualize distributions, correlations, etc.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale features, etc.
3. Model Selection: Experiment with different machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
5. Fine-tuning: Fine-tune hyperparameters of selected models to improve performance.
6. Conclusion: Summarize findings and suggest further improvements.

## Results
- Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of X%.
- Decision Trees achieved an accuracy of Y%.
- Further details can be found in the notebook.
